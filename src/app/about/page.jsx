        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>
          Commercial robotics have long been the privilege of few multinationals.
          With thousands of advancements in the field each year, robots are still
          far from reach for SMEs and individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          We exist to democratise robotics. By creating an open platform for all,
          everyone – from hobbyists to corporates – can create and customize their
          robotic solutions for every unique need. When robots become modular and
          affordable, human potential scales with them.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          In the AI era, useful creations are no longer dominated by large,
          professional organisations. Whoever has a great idea, ambitious, with a
          few AI agents, can create something valuable – and our platform is where
          these tiny bits and pieces can be shared, traded, and make great
          impacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2030, we aim to see millions of BotBloc cells in SMEs and households
          around the world, displacing dull, dirty, and dangerous roles. We welcome
          an ecosystem of passionate developers and users who are ready to thrive.
